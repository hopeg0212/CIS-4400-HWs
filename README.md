NYC Public Schools Demographic Analysis (2017-2022)
Overview
This project analyzes the demographics and economic trends in New York City public schools from 2017 to 2022. The analysis focuses on exploring enrollment patterns, gender ratios, racial/ethnic distributions, and economic need across different boroughs using data from the NYC Open Data portal. The findings aim to uncover disparities and trends that can inform policy decisions and resource allocation within the NYC public school system.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:

Examine key trends in student demographics (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender) and economic need in NYC public schools.
Provide insights into how these factors vary across boroughs and over time.
Utilize fact and dimension tables to facilitate flexible data querying and analysis.
Data Source
The data used in this analysis comes from the NYC Open Data portal's Demographic Snapshot. The dataset has been cleaned in Alteryx and includes detailed information on enrollment, race/ethnicity, gender, and economic need across five boroughs from 2017-2022.

Analysis
The notebook covers:

Enrollment Trends: Tracking total student enrollment across years and racial/ethnic groups.
Gender Ratios: Analyzing gender distributions across boroughs.
Racial/Ethnic Distribution: Exploring the racial/ethnic breakdown within each borough for the most recent year.
Economic Need Index (ENI): Measuring economic need across boroughs and identifying disparities.
Fact and Dimension Tables: Organizing the data for easy querying and analysis, focusing on boroughs, years, and enrollment figures.
Key Insights
Enrollment Decline: Significant declines in enrollment were observed across all racial/ethnic groups, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Economic Disparities: The Bronx has the highest Economic Need Index, indicating the greatest economic challenges faced by its students.
Demographic Breakdown: Hispanic and Black students make up the largest portions of the student population, with variations across boroughs.
Structure of the Notebook
